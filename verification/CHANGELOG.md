# Verification suite changelog

Every change to a build gate (added, changed or retired) is recorded here, newest first. The registry lint
fails if a gate in `gates.json` is not named in this file.

## 0.2.0

- Added `VG-BASELINE-LENS`: the baseline catalog cites at least two standards per control by clause reference
  (nothing the standards crosswalk files do not already map), is the default lens of an assessment that names no
  catalog, and every report lists the lenses a run can choose.

## 0.1.0

- Added the runner `verification/run` with `--quick`, `--full`, `--gate`, `--demo-fault`, `--lint-registry`,
  `--list` and `--json`, the gate registry `gates.json` and the results schema `results.schema.json`.
- Added `VG-SUITE-SELFTEST`: the runner reports pass, fail, skipped and timeout honestly, and the registry lint
  rejects a gate with no seeded fault, no claim or invariant, a malformed id, or a fault that does not apply.
- Added `VG-ATTESTATION-SIGNATURES`: an attestation is verified only after its DSSE signature verifies against
  a trusted key.
