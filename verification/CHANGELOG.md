# Verification suite changelog

Every change to a build gate (added, changed or retired) is recorded here, newest first. The registry lint
fails if a gate in `gates.json` is not named in this file.

## 0.4.0

- Added `VG-LOCKED-COPY`: the website builds, and the built landing page and the README carry the approved
  tagline, headline and subline word for word, with the wording they replaced gone.

## 0.3.0

- Added `VG-FIRST-REPORT-TIME`: an installed package turns a folder of OpenTelemetry GenAI or OpenInference
  records into a report with `agentce assess <folder>` and no other argument, offline, within five minutes of the
  start of the install; files it cannot read are listed with a reason and a folder with no recognised record is
  refused before anything is written.

## 0.2.0

- Added `VG-BASELINE-LENS`: the baseline catalog cites at least two standards per control by clause reference
  (nothing the standards crosswalk files do not already map), is the default lens of an assessment that names no
  catalog, and every report lists the lenses a run can choose.

## 0.1.0

- Added the runner `verification/run` with `--quick`, `--full`, `--gate`, `--demo-fault`, `--lint-registry`,
  `--list` and `--json`, the gate registry `gates.json` and the results schema `results.schema.json`.
- Added `VG-SUITE-SELFTEST`: the runner reports pass, fail, skipped and timeout honestly, and the registry lint
  rejects a gate with no seeded fault, no claim or invariant, a malformed id, or a fault that does not apply.
- Added `VG-ATTESTATION-SIGNATURES`: an attestation is verified only after its DSSE signature verifies against
  a trusted key.
