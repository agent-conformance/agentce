# CND-06 — google-adk

**Control:** Every untrusted instruction is refused

To satisfy CND-06 in a google-adk deployment, instrument the agent so it binds task effect scopes in the domain binding so the gateway emits within-scope and within-budget determinations, `Instruction` provenance, and `Refusal` events. Implement this with a Google ADK callback that exports each step through the `otel-genai` adapter; the adapter maps the framework's telemetry to the AgentCE evidence schema (SPEC §12) and the engine reads it as the control's minimum evidence (SPEC §7.6). This technique is informative and never changes an outcome (DC-10).
